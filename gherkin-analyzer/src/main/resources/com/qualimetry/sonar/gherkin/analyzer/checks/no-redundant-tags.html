<p>
  Scenario-level tags should not duplicate tags already set at the Feature level.
  Tags defined at the Feature level automatically apply to all scenarios within
  that feature. Repeating them at the scenario level is redundant and should be
  removed to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>Scenario tags that duplicate feature-level tags:</p>
<pre>
@smoke @regression
Feature: User authentication

  @smoke              &lt;!-- Noncompliant; duplicates Feature-level tag --&gt;
  Scenario: User logs in
    Given the user navigates to login
    When the user enters credentials
    Then the user is authenticated

  @regression         &lt;!-- Noncompliant; duplicates Feature-level tag --&gt;
  Scenario: User logs out
    Given the user is authenticated
    When the user clicks logout
    Then the user is logged out
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Remove redundant scenario-level tags:</p>
<pre>
@smoke @regression
Feature: User authentication

  Scenario: User logs in
    Given the user navigates to login
    When the user enters credentials
    Then the user is authenticated

  Scenario: User logs out
    Given the user is authenticated
    When the user clicks logout
    Then the user is logged out
</pre>

<p>
  Note: Tags that appear only at the scenario level (not at the Feature level)
  are allowed and should remain. Rule-level tag redundancy is handled by the
  companion rule <code>no-redundant-rule-tags</code>.
