<p>Feature, Scenario, and Rule names should not exceed a configurable maximum length.
Excessively long names are difficult to read in reports, IDE tooltips, CI logs, and
SonarQube dashboards. The default maximum is 120 characters, which aligns with
common line-length conventions.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Feature: This is an extremely long feature name that goes on and on describing every little detail of the entire feature in a single line which is very hard to read

  <!-- Noncompliant: scenario name exceeds 120 characters -->
  Scenario: Verify that when a user enters their username and password and clicks the login button then they are redirected to the main dashboard page showing all widgets
    Given a registered user
    When the user logs in
    Then the dashboard is displayed
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
Feature: User authentication

  Scenario: Successful login redirects to dashboard
    Given a registered user
    When the user logs in
    Then the dashboard is displayed
</pre>
