<p>
  Each data cell in an Examples table should contain a value. Empty cells
  usually indicate incomplete test data and can result in placeholder
  variables being substituted with empty strings. This may cause misleading
  test results where steps silently pass with blank values instead of
  testing meaningful data.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
Feature: Product search

  Scenario Outline: Search for products
    Given the user is on the search page
    When the user searches for "&lt;product&gt;"
    Then "&lt;count&gt;" results are displayed

    Examples:                                &lt;!-- Noncompliant --&gt;
      | product  | count |
      | laptop   |       |
      | keyboard | 8     |
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>count</code> cell in the first data row is empty. The
  <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> placeholder will be substituted with an empty
  string, which may cause the Then step to match incorrectly.
</p>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Populate all data cells with meaningful values:</p>
<pre>
Feature: Product search

  Scenario Outline: Search for products
    Given the user is on the search page
    When the user searches for "&lt;product&gt;"
    Then "&lt;count&gt;" results are displayed

    Examples:
      | product  | count |
      | laptop   | 15    |
      | keyboard | 8     |
</pre>

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
<p>
  This rule is off by default because some teams intentionally test with
  empty values (e.g., form validation with blank fields). Enable it only
  when empty cells always indicate incomplete test data in your project.
  Header row cells are not checked — only data rows (index 1+).
