<p>
  Tags that are common to all scenarios within a Feature should be placed at the
  Feature level instead of being repeated on each scenario. This reduces
  duplication, improves maintainability, and makes it clear which tags apply to
  the entire Feature scope.
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>Tags repeated on every scenario that should be at the Feature level:</p>
<pre>
Feature: Payment processing                &lt;!-- Noncompliant --&gt;

  @smoke @regression
  Scenario: Process credit card payment
    Given the customer has items in cart
    When the customer completes checkout
    Then payment is processed

  @smoke @regression
  Scenario: Process PayPal payment
    Given the customer has items in cart
    When the customer selects PayPal
    Then payment is processed
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Common tags moved to the Feature level:</p>
<pre>
@smoke @regression
Feature: Payment processing

  Scenario: Process credit card payment
    Given the customer has items in cart
    When the customer completes checkout
    Then payment is processed

  Scenario: Process PayPal payment
    Given the customer has items in cart
    When the customer selects PayPal
    Then payment is processed
</pre>

<p>
  Note: If a tag appears on most but not all scenarios, it should remain at the
  scenario level. Only tags that appear on <strong>every</strong> scenario within
  the Feature should be promoted. Rule-level tag promotion is handled by the
  companion rule <code>rule-tag-placement</code>.
